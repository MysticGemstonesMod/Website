# Wow! It's already been a year.

### What's been happening for the last year?

Time flies man... A whole year has passed since I started this, and it feels like it was yesterday that I made my first commit on GitHub.

It's been a crazy journey though. A lot has happened over the past year. Unfortunately, I didn't have as much time as I wanted to work on Mystic Gemstones because right after I finished high school, I started working at a 9-5 job, continued to practice programming, and spent a lot more time on random hobbies and other projects.

### How it all started?

It was the time when I had no idea of what I was doing. I had just started to learn programming and was looking for cool project ideas.

Since I grew up playing modded Minecraft, I decided that I wanted to make a Minecraft mod, but I didn't know what to make so I started experimenting, adding random stuff. I added my first simple block and item, Aquamarine Gem and Ore. As I learned more and more, I started experimenting with interactive blocks, giving abilities to items and much more... That's how Mystic Gemstones was born.

This is the first, or one of the first screenshots from the very beginning.

It is important to me because it is the first time I successfully extended Minecraft's Block class and made my own custom block that does something unique. Nothing special or complicated, but something unique. It was just a starting point for me; it was cool, I made it, and it gave me inspiration to continue making even more cool, simple, or even complicated blocks, items, and game mechanics.

### Future of Mystic Gemsones

Nothing's changed, I will continue to learn, develop the mod, and most importantly, have fun, just as I planned from the very beginning.

I have so many ideas and not even close to enough time to implement them all, but that's ok. I am in no hurry to 'finish' because there is no finish... I can always add more, fix bugs, and update to the latest version of Minecraft.

Sooo yeah, I guess that for now I will just enjoy the journey and see where it takes me next.
